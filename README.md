# Data-ETL-Automation-Pipeline
Designed and implemented an automated ETL pipeline to extract, transform, and structure complex billing data (LNN, COS lines) from unstructured documents into tidy CSVs for actionable analysis.

## Features
- Extract data from documents using Python
- Transform messy data into structured, clean CSVs
- Fully automated workflow that handles one file at a time, with simple path change to process different files
- Safe to share (no sensitive data included)
- 
## Folder Structure
- `data/` → Input documents (not committed if sensitive)
- `output/` → Generated CSV files
- `notebooks/` → Jupyter notebooks for ETL
- `scripts/` → Python scripts for automation
